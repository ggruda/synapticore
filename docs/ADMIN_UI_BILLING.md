Route::get('worklogs', [WorklogController::class, 'index']);
Route::get('worklogs/export', [WorklogController::class, 'export']);
Route::get('worklogs/{worklog}', [WorklogController::class, 'show']);
Route::post('worklogs/{worklog}/sync', [WorklogController::class, 'sync']);
Route::delete('worklogs/{worklog}', [WorklogController::class, 'destroy']);

// Invoices
Route::resource('invoices', InvoiceController::class);
Route::post('invoices/{invoice}/regenerate-pdf', ...);
Route::post('invoices/{invoice}/resend-email', ...);
Route::post('invoices/{invoice}/mark-paid', ...);
Route::post('invoices/{invoice}/mark-unpaid', ...);
Route::get('invoices/{invoice}/download-pdf', ...);
```

#### Security
